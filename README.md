3. Following C.R.A.P. guidelines:

  -Contrast - I specifically chose to use simple black and white color combinations of the background to make the meal/food pictures stand out. White background was used in order to distinguish the meal Titles, Descriptions and Price. Had I chosen any other color, I would have definitely messed with the text distinction. 

  -Repetition - I avoided using pretty much any other color, than black and white while designing all the elements to keep the sense of unity and coherence. The User is met with very simple patterns of texts with pictures and met by a Big Black Button "Order Now". Straightforward.

  -Alignment - as you might have noticed, I aligned text-picture pairs in a way, so they wouldn't be on the same vertical line. As the User reads lines from left to right, he is met with pictures at the end of the line and at the very beginning of the next one, grabbing his attention and urging him to continue this pattern scrolling the page until the very end.
  
  Oh, and there is an element of "hook" at the very beginning of the page - nothing but thought-provocative questions, which again grab User's attention to urge him to "reveal" the content underneath.

  -Proximity - pictures and meal Names and Descriptions are all packed up on one line, making the User realize they are related. There are also "break lines" between each "chunks" of picture-text pairs to avoid confusion while viewing the content from Mobile devices. 

  P.S. I haven't bothered implementing any other font-families as I was very happy with the current default one. I am the designer and this is how I like to see it. 

4. In order to improve the accessibility of the website, proper HTML elements were used, such as section, nav, h1, h2 so the screen readers would not have problems going though the structure of a website and alt tags were placed for <img> in case somehow images fail to load. 

5. To improve the search engine optimization, I resorted to the use of "description" tags in <meta> tags in the <head> of a HTML hierarchy. Also, I used "long-tail keywords" in the same description tag, as well as included keywords in the <title> elements of both pages. The text content throughout the pages is not some filler lorems, but actual readable texts with common keywords being added.
