        Somsa is a popular savory pastry originating from Uzbekistan
        and widely enjoyed across Central Asia.
        It consists of a delicate, flaky dough that encases a
        flavorful filling typically made from minced meat,
        often lamb, along with finely chopped onions and a blend of
        aromatic spices. The meat mixture is carefully
        wrapped in the dough and then baked or fried until the pastry turns golden
        brown and achieves a satisfyingly crispy texture.
